"Onepoto Caves","Formed by great landslides some 2,200 years ago, the Onepoto Caves were created by the same land movement that created Lake Waikaremoana. The caves range from small cavities to tunnels up to 20 metres long with multiple entrances. The caves can be reached via a 2-hour return walk from a lookout next to State Highway 38, 10km south of the Aniwaniwa Visitor Centre. Spend time exploring the caves but be sure to take a torch with you as the caves have little natural light and the cave floors can be slippery. Plus, watch out for weta - harmless insects that can be found in the caves!","Side trip","177.123876","-38.796824","3","25"
"Onepoto Redoubt","The second of three military sites, based at Onepoto during the Maori Land Wars, this redoubt was built in 1868. The approach to Panekire on the track brings you past the rock where soldiers carved their names in the 1860's, dating their graffiti, and across what was once the parade ground. Exploring the side track here uncovers the old camp ovens and other remnants of the redoubt.","Feature","177.114989","-38.801789"," ","15"
