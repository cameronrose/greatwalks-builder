"Kaipipi Bay","Today this is a tranquil picnic spot, but not so in the late 1800s - early 1900s when a long bridge and tramline spanned the Kaipipi shallows to allow saw millers to tap into the centuries old rimu which was the preferred timber for furniture and buildings.

"Gallon's Sawmill","The Rakiura Track runs past a number of old sawmill sites that once dotted the island's coastline. The first sawmill was built here in 1861 when Gallon dammed the small stream that flows into the head of Kaipipi Inlet to direct water into a race to a waterwheel to power his saw. No structures remain today, but there is still evidence of the rock lined pit where the waterwheel once stood and onsite interpretation tells the story of this mill.
