"Rakiura National Park Visitor Centre","A great place to get information on walking tracks around Halfmoon Bay and in Rakiura National Park. Hire locator beacons, purchase hut tickets, check the latest weather and get track updates. If it’s raining there is a fantastic range of videos about life on the island that you can watch.","VisitorCentre","168.126333","-46.898098"," ","30"
"Maori Beach Campsite and Shelter","After the mill closed in 1931 people gradually drifted away. Today the area is peaceful and picturesque, with regenerating forest quickly hiding evidence of those earlier days. Daffodils  as well as clumps of montbretia and bluebells can be seen - all that is left of the sawmill workers gardens.","Campsiteshelter","168.088","-46.8573","25"," "
"Port William Hut","In 1873 a group of 24 settlers from the Orkney and Shetland Islands were enticed here to establish a town. The provincial government had built barracks for them as part of a special settlement scheme. But infertile soils, the lack of markets for fish and isolation were too much, and 18 months later the town was abandoned.","Hut","168.087106","-46.835717","-10","10"
"North Arm Campsite and Shelter","The campsite is surrounded by regenerating podocarp forest, including Rimu, Miro and totara. Rakiura tokoeka/kiwi can be heard and sometimes seen around the campsite.  The foreshore near the hut was an important food gathering (mahinga kai) site for early Maori.","Campsiteshelter","168.0181","-46.8832","25"," "
